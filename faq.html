    <h3>WHY SHOULD I CLEAN MY DRYER VENT?</h3> 

    <p>Lint and other debris can build up in your dryer hose and vent duct, resulting in reduced air flow, backed up exhaust gases and eventually creating a fire. Annually there are around 18,000 dryer vent fires in the United States. These hazards can be avoided by thoroughly inspecting and cleaning your dryer vent every year.  A blocked vent or a vent with restricted airflow shortens the life of your dryer. It can lead to costly repairs if the fan, blower, or heating element burns out. A clogged dryer vent wastes more electric or natural gas to dry your clothes. If you need to use more than one dry cycle on your clothes to get them dry this suggests a clogged vent.</p>

            <h3>How Do We Clean Your Dryer Vent?</h3>
                <p>We utilize a powered rotary brush system that travels through the vent from one end to the other, shredding all clogs and sweeping the hardened built up lint from the walls of the vent. We then use a powerful Hepa collection unit with three industrial motors to suck all the debris out of your vent.</p>
